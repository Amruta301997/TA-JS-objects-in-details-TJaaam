# More about class

- Create a class named `Square` which accepts one parameter `side` and will set two property `width` and `height` to the value of `side`.
```js
class Square{
    constructor(side){
        let side = new Square(width , height);
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height; 
    }

    description(){
        alert (`The square is ${width} x ${height}`);
    }
    calcArea(){
        return this.side * this.side;
    }
    get area(){
        return this.side * this.side;
    }
    set area(value){
       this.side =  alert (`The square is ${width} x ${height}`);
    }
    static isEqual(s1,s2){
       if(side = width*height){
        alert `true`;
       }
       else{
        alert `false`;
       }
    }
}
let s1 = new Square(6);
let s2 = new Square(9);
```

- Add a method named `description` that will alert a message saying `The square is ${width} x ${height}`

- Create another method named `calcArea` that will return the area of the square.

- Create a getter method named `area` that will return area of the square.

- Create a setter method named `area` that will accept a value (the value will be the area of any square like 124). Based on the input value update the `width` and `height` of the square.(The width and the height will be updated to 12 (12 \* 12 = 124))

- Create a static method named `isEqual` which accepts two square instance (when you create a new object using the class). If the area of both square is same the method should return `true` or `false`. (Static methods are called directly on the class not in the instance)

- Create two instance of the `Square` class (ex: `let s1 = new Square(6);`)

- Check the `area` getter method on both square.

- Check the `isEqual` method and pass the two instance you created above.

## User Class

- Create a class named `User` that accepts `firstName` and `lastName` property

- Create a getter method named `fullName` that will return the full name of the person.

- Create a `fullName` setter method that will accept full name parameter of the person. It will update the `firstName` and `lastName` based on the input. (Say if the user passed `Arya Stark` it will update the `firstName` to `Arya` and `lastName` to `Stark`. It will also change one condition if the length of the name passed is less than 5 characters it will alert a message saying `Full name should be more than 5 characters`)

- Create a method named `nameContains` which will accept string and will return `true` or `false` based on if the name of the user contains the text that passed by user.

- Create two instance of the `User` class

- Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name bigger than 5 characters.

- Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name less than 5 characters.

- Check the `fullName` using getter

- Check the `nameContains` method
```js
class User{
    constructor(firstName,lastName){
       this.firstName = firstName;
       this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    get fullName(){
        return firstName + lastName;
    }
    set fullName(value){
        if(charAt(5) < fullName){
            alert `Full name should be more than 5 characters`;
        }
        else{
            this.fullName = value:firstName + value:lastName;
        }
         
    }
}
```
